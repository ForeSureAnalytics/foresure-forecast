## Overview

**ForeSure-Forecast** is a flexible forecasting engine designed to meet small business owners where they are ‚Äî starting with just historical sales and expanding as cleaner, richer data becomes available.

Each forecasting run:
- Tests **all applicable models** based on available inputs
- Scores each model for **historical accuracy**
- Returns a ranked output per SKU so you can choose the best-performing method

Whether you're running a Shopify store or a warehouse-backed brand, ForeSure-Forecast grows with you.

## Core Principles

- **Start Minimal**: Requires only SKU and historical sales
- **Scale Logically**: Inventory, lead times, seasonality, and supplier behavior can be toggled in
- **Run Everything**: When more models are unlocked, all prior models are still executed
- **Trust Data, Not Assumptions**: Best-fit model is chosen based on past performance, not guesswork

---

## Features

- ‚úÖ Plug-and-play with CSVs or backend data sources
- üìà Supports SES, DES, TES, and modular extensions
- üîÅ Auto-tunes smoothing constants for each model via grid search
- üß† SKU-level ranking of models by forecast accuracy
- üßÆ Optionally incorporates inventory, lead times, and supplier constraints
